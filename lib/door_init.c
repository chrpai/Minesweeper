/*
 * door_init.c - CNet door (PFile) lifecycle management
 *
 * Provides CNCL_DoorInit() and CNCL_DoorCleanup(), which replace the
 * original SAS/C cnet.lib implementations for use with m68k-amigaos-gcc.
 *
 * CNCL_DoorInit() opens cnetc.library, initializes the door context via
 * CNC_InitContext(), and populates the global pointers that door code
 * accesses directly (CNetCBase, context, z, myp, cport).
 *
 * CNCL_DoorCleanup() tears down the context and closes the library.
 * It is registered as an atexit() handler so that exit() from anywhere
 * in door code cleanly shuts down the CNet connection.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   CNet launches doors with argv[1] set to the CPort name.
 *   Call CNCL_DoorInit(argc, argv) at the top of main().
 *   On success it returns non-zero (TRUE); on failure, zero.
 *   The door calls exit() when finished; atexit runs cleanup.
 *
 * NOTE: This file calls CNC_* library functions AND needs CNet struct
 * definitions.  The inline stubs (LP* macros) require __asm as a GCC
 * keyword for register binding, but <cnet/cnet.h> redefines __asm to
 * nothing for SAS/C compatibility.  To resolve this:
 *   1. Include <proto/cnetc.h> FIRST (gets inline stubs with __asm intact)
 *   2. Do NOT include <cnet/cnet.h>
 *   3. Duplicate the minimal CNet struct definitions needed here
 *
 * Compile: m68k-amigaos-gcc -noixemul -Iinclude ...
